# Hostel Leave Component

## Overview

The `HostelLeave` component is a role-based router component in a React application that renders different interfaces based on the user's role. It determines whether to display the student view or administrative view for hostel leave management by checking the user's role from a context provider.

---

## Dependencies

- **React**: Core library for building the UI
- **React Context API**: For accessing role-based authentication state
- **Child Components**: `HostelLeaveStudent` and `HostelLeaveAdmin`

---

## Component Structure

### Imported Modules

- `React`, `useContext`, `useState` from 'react'
- `RoleContext` from '../../context/Rolecontext'
- `HostelLeaveStudent` component for student interface
- `HostelLeaveAdmin` component for administrative interface

### Context Usage

- The component consumes the `RoleContext` to access the user's role information
- Uses `useContext` hook to extract the `role` value from the context

---

## Functionality

### Role-Based Rendering

- **Student View**: Renders `<HostelLeaveStudent />` when the user's role is "student"
- **Administrative View**: Renders `<HostelLeaveAdmin />` when the user's role is "nonAcadAdmin"
- **Default Behavior**: If the role is neither "student" nor "nonAcadAdmin", nothing is rendered (returns `undefined`)

### Component Flow

1. The component retrieves the current role from `RoleContext`
2. It evaluates the role value using conditional statements
3. Based on the role, it renders the appropriate child component
4. If no matching role is found, it renders nothing

---

## Usage

```jsx
// Import the component
import HostelLeave from './path/to/HostelLeave';

// Use within a parent component
function ParentComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* HostelLeave will automatically render the appropriate view */}
      <HostelLeave />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> **Note**: The `HostelLeave` component must be used within a component tree that has a `RoleContext.Provider` ancestor.

---

## Dependencies on Other Components

### Context Provider

- Requires `RoleContext.Provider` to be present in the component tree
- Expects the context to provide a `role` value that can be either "student" or "nonAcadAdmin"

### Child Components

- **HostelLeaveStudent**: Component that provides the student-specific interface for hostel leave management
- **HostelLeaveAdmin**: Component that provides the administrative interface for managing hostel leave requests

---

## Implementation Details

- Uses functional component with React Hooks
- No local state management (relies on context for state)
- Implements conditional rendering based on role value
- Acts as a router/gateway component that delegates rendering to specialized components

---

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates user interfaces based on roles
- **Context API Usage**: Leverages React Context for global state management
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses clean conditional statements for rendering different views
- **Component Composition**: Composes specialized components rather than handling all logic in one place

---

## Enhancement Possibilities

- Add a fallback UI for unauthorized users or unrecognized roles
- Implement loading state while role information is being fetched
- Include error handling for context-related issues
- Add logging or analytics for role-based access
