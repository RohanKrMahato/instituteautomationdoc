# SiteAlert

## Overview

The `SiteAlert` component is a simple React component that displays an attendance alert message to users. It provides a visual notification when a student is short on attendance and offers guidance on resolving potential discrepancies.

## Features

- Clear visual alert for attendance shortage
- Additional contextual information about resolving discrepancies
- Minimal and focused UI for important notifications

## Component Structure

The component renders a notification box with:
1. A main alert message indicating attendance shortage
2. Additional context providing guidance on next steps

## Code Explanation

### Structure

The component is a simple functional component that returns JSX without props or state:

```javascript
function SiteAlert(){
    return(
        <div className="site-alert">
          <div className="frame-5">
            <p className="emergency-alert">You are short of Attendance!</p>
            <p className="additional-context">
              In case of discrepancy, contact your instructor through appeal section.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
    )
};
```

### Styling

The component uses CSS classes for styling:
- `site-alert`: Container for the alert
- `frame-5`: Wrapper for text content
- `emergency-alert`: Styling for the main alert message
- `additional-context`: Styling for the secondary information

### Commented Code

The component includes commented-out references to an `Icon` component:

```javascript
// import { Icon } from "./Icon";
// import { IconComponentNode } from "./IconComponentNode";
```

```javascript
{/* <Icon className="icon-instance" /> */}
```

These comments suggest that the component was originally designed to include an icon, but this feature is currently disabled.

## Usage Example

```jsx
import SiteAlert from './SiteAlert';

function StudentDashboard() {
  const attendanceStatus = {
    isShort: true,
    currentPercentage: 65
  };

  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <h1>Student Dashboard</h1>
      
      {attendanceStatus.isShort && <SiteAlert />}
      
      <div className="dashboard-content">
        {/* Other dashboard components */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Customization Opportunities

The component could be enhanced by:
1. Accepting props to customize the alert message
2. Adding severity levels (warning, critical, etc.)
3. Re-enabling the icon functionality with appropriate icons for different alert types
4. Adding an option to make the alert dismissible

## Notes

- This component is currently static and does not accept any props
- The alert text is hardcoded and cannot be changed without modifying the component
- The commented-out icon functionality suggests the component is part of a larger design system
