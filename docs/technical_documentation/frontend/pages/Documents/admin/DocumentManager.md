# Document Manager

## Overview

`DocumentManager` is a React component that serves as the main container for managing document applications within an academic administration system. It provides a unified interface where academic administrators can view, manage, and process document applications from students or other users.

## Component Structure

### Main Component: `DocumentManager`

The `DocumentManager` component acts as a container that conditionally renders different views based on the user's current interaction state. It handles routing between different sub-views within the document management system.

## State Management

The component uses React's useState hook to manage view states:

| State Variable | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `selectedApp` | Object\|null | Stores the currently selected application for detailed management |
| `viewingApp` | Object\|null | Stores the application being viewed in full detail mode |

## Role-Based Access Control

```javascript
const { role, setRole } = useContext(RoleContext);
setRole("acadAdmin")

// Check if user has admin access
if (!['acadAdmin'].includes(role)) {
    return <div>Access Denied</div>;
}
```

The component:
1. Accesses the global role context
2. Sets the current user role to "acadAdmin"
3. Verifies that the user has appropriate permissions to access this interface
4. Renders an "Access Denied" message if the user lacks necessary permissions

## View Navigation Logic

The component implements a simple state-based navigation system:

```javascript
return (
    <AdminLayout title="Document Applications Manager">
        {selectedApp ? (
            <ApplicationDetails
                application={selectedApp}
                onClose={() => setSelectedApp(null)}
                onViewFull={() => {
                    setViewingApp(selectedApp);
                    setSelectedApp(null);
                }}
            />
        ) : viewingApp ? (
            <ViewApplication
                application={viewingApp}
                onClose={() => setViewingApp(null)}
                onManage={() => {
                    setSelectedApp(viewingApp);
                    setViewingApp(null);
                }}
            />
        ) : (
            <ApplicationsList
                onSelect={setSelectedApp}
                onView={setViewingApp}
            />
        )}
    </AdminLayout>
);
```

This conditional rendering logic:
1. Renders `ApplicationDetails` when an application is selected for management
2. Renders `ViewApplication` when an application is being viewed in full detail
3. Renders `ApplicationsList` as the default view when no application is selected or being viewed

## Sub-Components

### AdminLayout

A wrapper component that provides consistent UI elements for administrative interfaces, including:
- Navigation
- Header with the page title
- Consistent styling and layout

### ApplicationsList

Displays a list of document applications with:
- Filtering capabilities
- Sorting options
- Selection mechanisms
- Preview information

### ApplicationDetails

Presents a detailed management interface for a selected application:
- Approval/rejection controls
- Note/comment addition
- Document verification tools
- Status update capabilities

### ViewApplication

Shows a comprehensive view of all application details:
- Complete application information
- Attached documents
- Student/applicant details
- Application history

## Component Flow

1. User starts at the `ApplicationsList` view
2. User can either:
   - Select an application for management (transitions to `ApplicationDetails`)
   - Choose to view an application (transitions to `ViewApplication`)
3. From `ApplicationDetails`, user can:
   - Return to list (via `onClose`)
   - View full application (transitions to `ViewApplication`)
4. From `ViewApplication`, user can:
   - Return to list (via `onClose`)
   - Manage the application (transitions to `ApplicationDetails`)

## Props and Callbacks

### ApplicationsList Props
- `onSelect`: Function to set the selected application for management
- `onView`: Function to set the application for full viewing

### ApplicationDetails Props
- `application`: The application object being managed
- `onClose`: Function to return to the applications list
- `onViewFull`: Function to transition to the full view of the application

### ViewApplication Props
- `application`: The application object being viewed
- `onClose`: Function to return to the applications list
- `onManage`: Function to transition to managing the application

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only users with the "acadAdmin" role can access this interface
2. **Component-Level Authorization**: Access checking is performed within the component itself
3. **Protected Routes**: Should be combined with route-level protection for comprehensive security

## Dependencies

- **React**: Core library for UI components
- **React Context API**: For role-based access control via RoleContext
- **Custom Components**: AdminLayout, ApplicationsList, ApplicationDetails, ViewApplication

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Conditional Rendering**: Different views based on state
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component handles a specific aspect of functionality
3. **Context for Global State**: User role is managed via context
4. **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Parent component passes data down to children
5. **Callback Props**: For communication from child to parent components

## Error Handling

The component implements basic error handling through role verification. Additional error handling should be implemented in the child components for:
- API request failures
- Data validation issues
- Permission-specific operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **State Management Scale-up**: Consider Redux or Context API for more complex state as the application grows
2. **Route-Based Navigation**: Implement URL-based routing for direct access to specific applications
3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Add breadcrumbs for easier navigation between views
4. **Batch Operations**: Add capabilities for handling multiple applications simultaneously
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement more sophisticated filtering options
