## Important Notes
- Email addresses must follow the format: `username@iitg.ac.in` (only letters and . are allowed in the username)
- Date of Birth cannot be set to a future date
- Date of Birth should be chronologically before the Year of Joining (faculty cannot join before being born)
- Year of Joining cannot be later than the current year
- Conference years should be within a reasonable timeframe (not before the faculty's date of birth and not after the current year)
- For multi-value fields (qualifications, experience, etc.), all current entries must be filled before adding a new entry
- All three conference fields (name, year, role) must be completed before adding another conference entry
- The system automatically creates a user account for the faculty member with their email as the default password
- Faculty members should be advised to change their default password upon first login for security purposes
- The faculty's email address must be unique in the system
- The system assumes all data entered is valid administrative information (e.g., department names, designations, etc.)
- All academic information provided (qualifications, specializations, etc.) is assumed to be verified by the academic administrator before entry

## Additional Information
- **Contact Number Format**: Enter digits only, with country code if applicable
- **Blood Group Format**: Use standard notation (e.g., A+, B-, O+, AB+)
- **Data Persistence Warning**: Do not refresh or navigate away from the page during submission as this may result in data loss
- **Privacy Notice**: Faculty information entered will be accessible to authorized administrative personnel only and will be used for institutional purposes
- **After Successful Submission**: You will receive an alert confirming successful addition of the faculty member, and the system will be ready for another entry if needed

## Troubleshooting
- If form submission fails with an alert message, review the form for any validation errors
- If you encounter field validation errors, check the specific format requirements mentioned above
- If the submission fails, check your internet connection and try again
