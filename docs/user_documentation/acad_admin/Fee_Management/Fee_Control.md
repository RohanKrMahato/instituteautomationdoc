**6. Important Notes**

*   **Permissions:** This page is intended for users with administrative privileges for managing academic fee data.
*   **Data Accuracy:** Ensure all fee amounts entered are accurate, as this data will likely be used for student fee calculations and records.
*   **Completeness:** All fee component fields under "Fee Details" are mandatory when adding a new structure.
*   **Read-Only List:** The "Fee Structures List" tab is for viewing only. To modify an existing structure, you might need to consult system documentation for update/delete procedures (which are not present on this specific page) or potentially add a new corrected entry for the same year/program if updates aren't supported directly.
