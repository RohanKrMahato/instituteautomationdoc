# **Create Assignment Module**

## **1\. Overview**

This page allows faculty members to create new assignments for their courses. It provides a form with fields to define the assignment's title, description, and due date. Once the required information is entered, faculty can create the assignment, making it available to students enrolled in the course.

## **2\. Page Layout**

When a faculty member navigates to the "Create Assignment" page, they will typically see a form with the following input fields and controls:

* **Title:** A text input field where the faculty member can enter the title of the assignment. This is usually a mandatory field.  
* **Description:** A larger text area where the faculty member can provide detailed instructions, guidelines, or context for the assignment.  
* **Due Date:** A date and time picker component that allows the faculty member to specify the deadline for the assignment submission. This often includes options to select the date and time.  
* **Create Assignment Button:** A prominent button, usually green, which, when clicked, submits the entered information and creates the new assignment.

The form is generally presented in a clear and organized manner to facilitate easy input of the assignment details.

## **3\. Features and How to Use Them**

### **3.1 Entering Assignment Details**

To create a new assignment:

1. In the **Title** field, enter a descriptive title for the assignment. This should be clear and easily understandable by the students.  
2. In the **Description** text area, provide comprehensive instructions, requirements, and any necessary background information for the assignment. Be as clear and concise as possible to avoid confusion.  
3. Use the **Due Date** picker to select the date and time when the assignment is due. Ensure that you set a reasonable deadline for students to complete the work. You can typically click on the date field to open a calendar and may also have separate controls for setting the time.

### **3.2 Creating the Assignment**

Once you have entered the title, description, and due date:

1. Click the **Create Assignment** button.  
2. The system will process the information and create the new assignment for the course you were on when you navigated to this page. You will likely receive a confirmation message or be redirected to the assignments list page where the newly created assignment will be visible.

**Note:** Ensure that all mandatory fields (typically the Title) are filled before attempting to create the assignment.
