# Course Registration Approval System

This guide will help you navigate the Course Registration Approval System as a faculty member. The system allows you to efficiently manage student registration requests for courses you are teaching.

## Your Courses Dashboard

When you click on **Registration** in the sidebar menu, you'll see a dashboard displaying all courses you're currently teaching. This dashboard serves as your starting point for managing course registrations.

### Course Cards

Each course is displayed as a card containing:
- The **course name** (e.g., CS101, MA102)
- The **course code**
- Each card is clickable to access student registration requests

Simply click on any course card to view and manage the registration requests for that specific course.

## Managing Student Registration Requests

After selecting a course from the dashboard, you'll be taken to the **Course Registration Approvals** page where you can:

- View all pending student registration requests in a table format
- See comprehensive student details for each request
- Take action on each request individually

### Student Request Information

For each registration request, you'll see:
- **Roll Number:** The student's unique identifier
- **Program:** The academic program the student is enrolled in
- **Semester:** The current semester of the student
- **Course Code:** The code for the course being requested
- **Course Type:** Whether the course is Core or Elective

### Taking Action on Requests

For each student request, you have two options:

1. **Approve**  
   - Click this button to register the student for your course  
   - This confirms the student's enrollment  
   - The student will be notified of the approval

2. **Reject**  
   - Click this button to deny the student's registration request  
   - This prevents the student from enrolling in your course  
   - The student will be notified of the rejection

> Both buttons are temporarily disabled during processing to prevent duplicate submissions.

If there are no pending requests for your course, you'll see a message stating **"No pending approval requests."**

## Navigation Features

The system includes a comprehensive sidebar menu with the following options:
- **Course**
  - Registration (current section)
  - Attendance Tracking
  - Grades Submission
  - Assignments
  - Announcements
- **Complaint**
- **Profile**

You can return to the course selection dashboard at any time by clicking **Course Registration** in the sidebar.

## Best Practices

- Review student information carefully before approving or rejecting requests
- Process requests promptly to allow students to adjust their course selections if needed
- Use the logout button in the top-right corner when you're finished to ensure security
