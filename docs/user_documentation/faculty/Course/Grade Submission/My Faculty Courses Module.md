## **2\. Page Layout**

When a faculty member navigates to the **My Faculty Courses** page, the content is typically organized as a grid or a list of course tiles or cards. Each course is represented by a distinct section containing the following information:

* **Course Title:** The name of the course (e.g., Testcourse, Introduction to Computer Science).  
* **Course Code:** The unique identifier for the course (e.g., CS900, CS101).  
* **Action Button:** A prominent button, usually labeled "Submit Grades," allowing faculty to navigate to the grade submission interface for that specific course.

The courses are visually separated, making it easy for faculty to quickly identify their assigned subjects and access the grade submission functionality.
