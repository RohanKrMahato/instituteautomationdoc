## 4. Important Notes

*   **Data Accuracy:** The information displayed and used in the generated PDF is based on the official records available in the system. If you find any discrepancies (e.g., incorrect name, roll number, contact, blood group), please contact the relevant administrative office (e.g., Student Affairs, Academic Section) immediately.
*   **Validity:** Check the "Valid Until" date on your ID card information. If the date has passed or is incorrect, contact the administration for renewal or correction.
*   **Generation Time:** Generating the PDF may take a few moments.
*   **Pop-up Blockers:** If the download doesn't start after clicking the "Download PDF" button, ensure that your browser's pop-up blocker is not preventing the download. You may need to allow downloads from this website.
*   **Photo:** The photo used on the ID card is typically sourced from your student profile picture in the system. If it's missing or incorrect, you may need to update your profile through the appropriate channels.
