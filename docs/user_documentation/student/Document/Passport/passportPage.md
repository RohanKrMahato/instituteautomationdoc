## 4. Important Notes

*   **Data Accuracy:** Ensure all your pre-filled student information is correct *before* applying. Errors in this data will reflect on the certificate. Contact administration for corrections if needed.
*   **Tatkal Processing:** Selecting "Tatkal" requires justification. Be prepared to provide supporting evidence for urgency if requested by the administration, even if not uploaded via the form. Tatkal processing may also involve different procedures or fees as per institutional rules.
*   **Processing Time:** Applications take time to process. The status will be updated in the "Application Status" tab as it moves through the administrative workflow.
*   **Collection:** Once the status shows as "Approved" or "Ready for Collection", follow the institutional procedure for collecting the physical certificate (if applicable). Check for any remarks regarding collection.
*   **Contact:** For specific questions about your application status or required procedures not covered here, contact the designated administrative office (e.g., Academic Section, Dean of Student Affairs Office).
