## 5. Important Notes & Troubleshooting

- **One Request Limit:** You can only have one pending transfer request at a time. You must wait for a decision on your current request before submitting a new one.
- **Hostel Options:** The available hostels in the dropdown are filtered based on your gender, excluding your current hostel.
- **Response Messages:** If you see a yellow message box at the bottom of the page, it indicates important information about your request submission. This might include errors or confirmation messages.
- **Form Not Appearing:** If the "Apply for Transfer" button is not visible, you likely already have a pending request.
- **Empty Tabs:** If a tab shows "No pending requests," "No approved requests," or "No rejected requests," you don't have any requests in that category.
