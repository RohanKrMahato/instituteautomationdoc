- **Plan Implementation:** After approval, your new meal plan will generally take effect within 24 hours.
- **Status Colors:**

  - Approved (Green): Request has been approved
  - Rejected (Red): Request has been denied (with reason provided)
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If the "Submit Request" button is disabled, check that:
    - You've selected a different plan than your current one
    - You don't already have a pending request
  - If you can't see your request history, try refreshing the page
  - If error messages appear, follow any instructions provided or try again later
  - For persistent issues, contact the mess administration office
