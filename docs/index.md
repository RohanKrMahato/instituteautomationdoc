# Welcome to the Institute Automation System Documentation

The **Institute Automation System** is a comprehensive web-based solution developed as part of the **CS345/CS346 Software Engineering Lab** course at **IIT Guwahati**, under the guidance of **Prof. Pradip K. Das**. This project aims to streamline and automate the administrative workflows of IIT Guwahati’s academic section and hostel services, addressing inefficiencies in processes such as course registration, grade submission, transcript generation, assignment management, attendance tracking, and hostel-related services like leave applications, mess subscriptions, and complaint management.

Our goal is to create a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform that enhances operational efficiency, reduces manual errors, and improves the experience for students, faculty, and administrators. By integrating robust features with a modern technology stack, the system ensures scalability, security, and seamless interaction across all user roles.

## Key Objectives
- Automate academic record management and course-related processes.
- Provide a unified platform for assignment submission, grading, and attendance tracking.
- Simplify document requests and transcript generation.
- Streamline hostel services, including leave applications, mess subscriptions, and complaint resolution.
- Ensure secure authentication and role-based access control.

This documentation serves as a complete guide to the system’s features, technical architecture, and user workflows. Explore the sections in the navbar to learn more about the implementation, functionalities, and usage of the Institute Automation System.
